# modern_ui_design_test

This one is just made in one of my free times! 
The UI on this application is really simple and beautiful.

## The Idea

  The Idea was from my random thoughts and especially from a pinterest post! I vaguely remember that post, But just by trying to imagine what I saw on that post~
  made me do this application on flutter! 
  
## The process
  
  I was just doodling and doing something really random with inkscape. I made some simple circular shapes~
and...! Now, it's the background image of my app.

  Firstly, I made some circles on different sizes & gave some colors.
  Secondly, I exported the image from inkscape as an SVG. And then I imported and placed on my flutter project!
  Thirdly, I wraped everything with the stack widget (the Underneath layer is obviously the Image). And I've added some blur on top of it!
  Lastly, The contents are placed above the image layer. In code, below the image & blur part.
  

## Pages
  Right now, there are two pages that are imported to the main.dart file. one is called home_page.dart & the other one is called landing_page.dart  ~~
  LandingPage looks like a glass kinda UI. on the other hand the HomePage has a unique .GIF on the back ground with a cool looking font in the front.
