Vandenbroucke is a typeface designed by Simon Bravard the first months of 2020. Sharp, contrasting, condensed, exuberant, this typeface pays tribute to the Belgian cyclist Franck Vandenbroucke, former international championship cyclist. Promised to a great future with his amazing results in his early professional career years in the late 1990s, he was involved in dope cases and had a drug problem. He tragically died in his hotel room during a trip to Senegal in 2009. An elegant biker with a unique style made of great panache, he had the gift of making people passionate when he was at the peak of his art. He is undoubtedly one of the legends of modern cycling.

The font may be subject to modification, improvement, adjustment or extension in the more or less near future. As it stands, the Vandenbrouck typeface is freely downloadable and usable by anyone, privately or professionally, under a Creative Commons CC BY-ND 4.0 license.
